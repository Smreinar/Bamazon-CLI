In this app, we have made a DataBase using MySQL filled with random products to buy, and when you start the app, you will receive the list of products with the name quantity and price for them. After the list of products are brought up, you will be able to type in a product number to select which product you wish to purchase. after you have chosen the product, you can then type in the quantity that you would want to contain 
after you've made your purchase, the database then will update the amount available depending on how much you have purchased.

Clone the repository to try to buy something yourself and have FUN!!
